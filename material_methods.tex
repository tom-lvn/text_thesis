\section{Data sources}
Fishing effort data was obtained from Global Fishing Watch (GFW). They generate
a publicly available global dataset of apparent fishing hours based on AIS data \citep{gfw_dataset}. 
For this, GFW analyses >190,000 unique AIS devices which are each assigned a unique Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI).
The AIS devices ping the location of the vessel up to every 2 seconds \citep{kontasvesselupdate, taconet2019global}. Along with the exact location,
the AIS message also transmits the time, speed, and heading of the vessel. These positional data points are then analysed by two 
different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) which are described in detail in \cite{Kroodsma18}. 
The first CNN classifies fishing vessels into one of sixteen categories.


\section{Data filtering}
Global apparent fishing hours were:\begin{enumerate}
    \item daily csv files aggregated for each year
    \item cropped with Med shapefile
    \item filtered for gear type drifting longlines and purse seiners
    \item filtered with ICCAT registry being listed
    \item known purse seiners assigned a different gear type were added from own database
    \item 0 added where value was recorded in one year but not in others
\end{enumerate}
