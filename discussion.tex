\begin{itemize}
    \item Summarize findings and methods
    \item Compare with other studies looking into effort of these gear types
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not possible to get effort per metier with AIS (at least with GFW methods right now) -> problematic
    \end{itemize}
    \item Shortcomings of AIS
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What are the caveats identified during the study?
        \item Which different methods exist to analyse AIS data? Which one is suitable when and for what?
    \end{itemize}
    \item What can we infer from AIS derived fishing activity and what not?
    \item Future perspectives
