  abstract = {Abstract The incidental capture by marine fisheries as bycatch poses a global threat to pelagic sharks and rays. In large, industrialized fisheries that often operate in areas beyond national jurisdiction, at least 22 threatened species of pelagic elasmobranchs are caught as bycatch, representing the majority of megafauna bycatch in tuna fisheries. Here, we investigate (1) the efficacy of the current policies of the five tuna-related Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (tRFMOs) in mitigating elasmobranch bycatch, (2) data needed to better assess the amount and impact of elasmobranch bycatch and (3) the research necessary for the adoption of new policies. We found that tRFMOs have adopted 34 active policies that address pelagic elasmobranch bycatch. However, most policies (~76\%, n = 26) are unlikely to avoid or minimize elasmobranch bycatch. Instead, most policies focus on mitigating post-capture mortality via remediation and requiring or encouraging research and data collection. Despite the emphasis on research mandates, we find that the existence of research was not related to policy adoption, suggesting that lack of research has not historically prohibited policymaking. Overall, we suggest that current research and data transparency, though perhaps not necessary for policy adoption, are not sufficient to adequately evaluate the population-level impacts of bycatch on many elasmobranch species in tRFMO-managed fisheries. Given these results, we recommend a precautionary approach that involves reforms in tRFMO voting processes to facilitate the adoption of binding requirements for elasmobranch catch limits, bycatch avoidance, pre- and post-capture handling and release modifications and protection of areas important to threatened pelagic elasmobranchs.},

    abstract = {The European Union and other states are moving towards Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management to balance food production and security with wider ecosystem concerns. Fishing is only one of several sectors operating within the ocean environment, competing for renewable and non-renewable resources that overlap in a limited space. Other sectors include marine mining, energy generation, recreation, transport and conservation. Trade-offs of these competing sectors are already part of the process but attempts to detail how the seas are being utilised have been primarily based on compilations of data on human activity at large spatial scales. Advances including satellite and shipping automatic tracking enable investigation of factors influencing fishers’ choice of fishing grounds at spatial scales relevant to decision-making, including the presence or avoidance of activities by other sectors. We analyse the determinants of English and Welsh scallop-dredging fleet behaviour, including competing sectors, operating in the eastern English Channel. Results indicate aggregate mining activity, maritime traffic, increased fishing costs, and the English inshore 6 and French 12 nautical mile limits negatively impact fishers’ likelihood of fishing in otherwise suitable areas. Past success, net-benefits and fishing within the 12 NM predispose fishers to use areas. Systematic conservation planning has yet to be widely applied in marine systems, and the dynamics of spatial overlap of fishing with other activities have not been studied at scales relevant to fisher decision-making. This study demonstrates fisher decision-making is indeed affected by the real-time presence of other sectors in an area, and therefore trade-offs which need to be accounted for in marine planning. As marine resource extraction demands intensify, governments will need to take a more proactive approach to resolving these trade-offs, and studies such as this will be required as the evidential foundation for future seascape planning.},

In this paper we introduce the first map of fishing activity at a Mediterranean scale of EU and non-EU fishing vessels, extracted using Automatic Identification System ship tracking data. Fishing activity maps were produced for three different years with a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01°. As a main result, for the first time, changes of bottom trawl fishing activities between two consecutive years were map for the whole Mediterranean Sea. The results confirmed the suitability of this monitoring system to obtain reliable information on the extent of bottom trawl fishing activities.}

We review the life history strategies of these migratory fish and to compare to the life history strategies of major coastal migrants. The oceanography in this region is dominated by north and south currents that provide a boundary between the offshore and coastal waters. Commercial fisheries off the west coast of North America are virtually all inshore of this oceanographic separation. Migrations for some species in these major fisheries are also north and south rather than east and west. However, exceptions occur for Pacific salmon, species associated with seamounts, and for transitional pelagic species such as tuna, squid and sharks. Three species of Pacific salmon, sockeye, pink and chum salmon, migrate along the coast in their first marine year and move off shore in the fall and winter in their first marine year. Three other species, coho salmon, chinook salmon, and steelhead trout, also migrate offshore, although they are less abundant and some stocks remain within the coastal regions. Pacific salmon species are a dominant daytime biomass in the surface waters in the offshore areas. It is known that albacore tuna and some sharks migrate between the offshore and coastal areas, but more research is needed to assess the relative importance of these migrations. Although the biomass of species on seamounts is small relative to coastal areas, the similarity in fauna is evidence that there is recruitment from coastal ecosystems.}

ABSTRACT = {Migrations of large pelagic fishes across the Pacific are usually inferred from tagging or genetic studies. Even though these techniques have improved over time, they still fail to demonstrate large transoceanic migrations, usually proposing ‘routes’ that do not cycle seasonally. The current study uses the concept of ‘philopatry’ in 11 large pelagic fish species, i.e., the tendency for animals to return to their natal site to reproduce. Tentative migration routes and maps emerge by applying this concept to the movements extracted through a comprehensive review of the literature on satellite and conventional tagging, and population and subpopulation linkages inferred from genetic and/or genomic studies. Moreover, when comparing these proposed migration routes and the mapped reconstructed catch (1950–2016, Sea Around Us) of each species in the Pacific, similarities emerge, reinforcing the accuracy of these migration cycles informed by philopatry. Finally, by superposing the migration routes of our 11 species, we identified areas of the Pacific that are part of the inferred migration routes of multiple species, leading to a discussion of possible ‘blue corridors’ that would protect the studied species’ key migration routes and stocks, which are important for the fisheries, culture and nutrition of Pacific islanders.},

@article{swordfish_migration,
	abstract = {Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are a widely distributed (45$\,^{\circ}$N--45$\,^{\circ}$S) large pelagic fish targeted by fisheries worldwide. Swordfish that occur at high latitudes tend to disproportionately be large adults, so their movements have implications for population dynamics and fisheries management. In the southwest Pacific, little is known about this subset of the stock and existing evidence suggests limited movement from the subtropics into cooler high latitude waters. Here, we capitalize on the recent emergence of a recreational swordfish fishery off temperate southeast Australia to characterize movements of swordfish caught in the fishery with pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags. Data were recovered from tags deployed for 56--250 days on 11 swordfish (50--350 kg) tagged between 38 and 43$\,^{\circ}$S in the western Tasman Sea. Five swordfish entered the Coral Sea (< 30$\,^{\circ}$S), with four reaching north to 11--24$\,^{\circ}$S, up to 3275 km away from location of capture. Behavior modelling suggests these four individuals rapidly transited north until encountering 23--27 $\,^{\circ}$C water, at which point they lingered in the area for several months, consistent with spawning-related partial migration. One migrating swordfish still carrying a tag after the spawning season returned to \~{} 120 km of its release location, suggesting site fidelity. Movements toward the central south Pacific were confined to two individuals crossing 165$\,^{\circ}$E. Swordfish predominantly underwent normal diel vertical migration, descending into the mesopelagic zone at dawn (median daytime depth 494.9 m, 95{\%} CI 460.4--529.5 m). Light attenuation predicted daytime depth, with swordfish rising by up to 195 m in turbid water. At night, swordfish were deeper during the full moon, median night-time depth 45.8 m (37.8--55.5) m versus 18.0 m (14.9--21.8) m at new moon. Modelling fine-scale (10 min−1) swordfish depth revealed dynamic effects of moon phase varying predictably across time of night with implications for fisheries interactions. Studying highly migratory fishes near distribution limits allows characterization of the full range of movement phenotypes within a population, a key consideration for important fish stocks in changing oceans.},

abstract = {Abstract Both old and new information on the biology and ecology of Atlantic bluefin tuna have confronted scientists with research challenges: research needs to be connected to current stock-assessment and management issues. We review recent studies on habitat, migrations and population structure, stressing the importance of electronic tagging results in the modification of our perception of bluefin tuna population dynamics and behaviour. Additionally, we question, from both scientific and management perspectives, the usefulness of the classical stock concept and suggest other approaches, such as Clark's contingent and metapopulation theories. Current biological information confirms that a substantial amount of uncertainty still exists in the understanding of reproduction and growth. In particular, we focus on intriguing issues such as the difference in age-at-maturity between West Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna. Our description of Atlantic bluefin tuna fisheries places today's fishing patterns within the two millennium history of exploitation of this species: we discuss trap fisheries that existed between the 17th and the early 20th centuries; Atlantic fisheries during the 1950s and 1960s; and the consequences of the recent development of the sushi–sashimi market. Finally, we evaluate stock status and management issues since the early 1970s. While important uncertainties remain, when the fisheries history is confronted with evidence from biological and stock-assessment studies, results indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna has been undergoing heavy overfishing for a decade. We conclude that the current exploitation of bluefin tuna has many biological and economic traits that have led several fish stocks to extreme depletion in the past.},

Automatic Identification System (AIS) data provide a means of mapping fishing and estimating human-wildlife risk; however, risk can be obscured by gaps in the AIS record due to technical issues and intentional disabling. We assessed the extent to which unseen fishing vessel activity due to AIS gaps obscured estimates of overlap between fishing vessel activity and 14 marine predators including sharks, tunas, mammals, seabirds, and critically endangered leatherback turtles. Among vessels equipped with AIS in the northeast Pacific, up to 24\% of total predator overlap with fishing vessel activity was unseen, and up to 36\% was unseen for some individual species. Waters near 10°N had high unseen overlap with sharks yet low reported shark catch, revealing potential discrepancies in self-reported datasets. Accounting for unseen fishing vessel activity illuminates hidden human-wildlife risk, demonstrating challenges and solutions for transparent and sustainable marine fisheries. Gaps in Automatic Identification System data obscure human-wildlife risk at sea, masking the urgency of risk mitigation.}

abstract = {Monitoring fishing activities is crucial for marine conservation but challenging in practice, because the ability in tracking fisheries has been limited on varying spatial and temporal scales. The challenge is for both developed and developing countries, and is outstanding in China which is characterized by the world's largest fishing fleet. The advance of Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides the opportunity to enforce monitoring and to promote the compliance of responsible fisheries. Here, the dynamics of fishing fleets in China Seas were integrally investigated for the first time. We demonstrated heavy fishing efforts widely distributed across China Seas, whereas most vessels were concentrated along the coastal line. The temporal pattern of fishing efforts was dominated by summer moratorium, and intensive fishing occurred immediately before and after the moratorium. We highlight that most fishing activities occurred in a remarkably limited spatial and temporal scope, particularly trawling vessels which spent a few months on fishing every year and covered a small geographical area. Additionally, considerable fishing efforts have transferred from Eastern China Sea to the coastal areas of south China in response to an extension of summer moratorium, which requires the fishing moratorium beginning one month earlier since 2017. We argue that summer moratorium cannot effectively control overall fishing efforts, but rearrange the same level of efforts in space and time. We highlight caveats in the interpretation of AIS data in terms of reception issues, meanwhile the novel information provided by AIS can refine the understanding of fleet dynamics and contribute to adaptive fisheries management over broad spatial and temporal scales.}

We then explore how these developments are informing our understanding of the major trophic groups in food webs leading to, and including, marine top predators. We examine through specific examples how the impacts of ocean warming may affect pelagic food web relationships from both top-down and bottom-up perspectives. We examine the potential, in the absence of long-term data sets, of using large-scale spatial studies to examine how potential changes in biological oceanography could impact the biomass and composition of prey species, particularly the role of phytoplankton size spectra. We focus on examples from regions where biotic change with respect to climate change is likely. In particular, we detail the effects of climate change on oceanographic and bathymetric “hotspots” and provide the example involving seabirds in the Benguela Current system. We end by urging the development of international collaborations and databases to facilitate comprehensive ocean-scale understanding of climate impacts on marine top predators.}

abstract = {Summary 1 Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2 Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3 In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, ‘pseudo-experimental’ analyses of predator–prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as ‘replicates’, and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as ‘treatments’, are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4 Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator–prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5 Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6 Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.},

These indicators are devised to use the information provided by the Vessel Monitoring System, a mandatory tool for EU fishing vessels which allows to record fishing activity in space and time. This study reports and analyzes trends of DCF fishing pressure indicators in the years 2007–2010 for the Italian trawlers in seven Mediterranean geographic sub-areas and the related trends of landing per unit effort. In addition, new versions of these indicators are developed and their performances compared to the DCF ones by a simulation approach. The rationale for these new version of indicators is based on: (i) the development of a formal definition of “fishing ground”, allowing for innovative statistical analyses of fishing patterns in space and time; (ii) the revision of issues affecting DCF indicators. Results provide: (i) the first extensive documentation of space use by fisheries through time; (ii) evidences of subtle yet significant changes in fishing pattern which, in agreement to other studies, indirectly support a decline of fisheries resources in the Mediterranean; (iii) improved versions of DCF fishing pressure indicators, obtained via the identification and analysis of fishing grounds and the assessment of aggregation by Gini's G index. The latter point could mark an important progress in order to overcome some critical weakness evidenced by DCF indicators. Moreover, the statistical identification and analysis of fishing grounds could represent a valuable insight in quantitative investigations of fisheries impacts and effects, even beyond indicators computation.}

Indicators of fishing pressure are necessary to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). We present a framework that distinguishes four levels of pressure indicators that move from being a simple description of anthropogenic activity to more precisely describing the actual pressure on the ecosystem and its components, but which require increasingly more information to be quantified. We use the example of the Dutch beam trawl fleet in the North Sea to compare these pressure indicators, as the level of information used is increased. The first level is that of fleet capacity (e.g. number of vessels), the second is fishing effort, usually expressed as the number of hours fishing or days at sea, the third incorporates fishing parameters such as the proportion of time actually spent fishing, fishing speed, or gear characteristics, e.g. the size of the beam trawl in order to determine the frequency with which an area is fished, and at the fourth level, the most informative measure of fishing pressure, annual fishing mortality, is available for a few commercial species from stock assessments. For other species, it can be calculated from the lower level pressure indicators through the incorporation of the chance of individuals of a species coming into contact with the fishing gear and the encounter mortality, which is the portion of mortality caused by the passing of the gear. Comparison of trends and absolute values shows that the pressure indicators at different levels differ considerably in their description of both present and historical fishing impact in the North Sea. Therefore, for an EAFM, we advise using the highest level pressure indicator that can be obtained with the data available.},

    abstract = {When fisheries managers cannot see who is fishing or where fishing occurs, their scope for management interventions is limited. This lack of transparency in spatial fishing activity is considered a key enabler of illegal fishing and overfishing and hinders managers and consumers who aim to achieve sustainable fisheries. Increasing transparency in vessel location tracking is gaining momentum as a promising way to improve management of global fisheries. However, the mechanisms through which transparency in vessel activity can improve management have not been carefully studied. This paper provides a conceptual overview of the potential for greater transparency, both in quantity of vessels tracked and availability of data, from vessel tracking to help achieve sustainable fisheries goals. We identify four pathways through which these data can improve fisheries management and the conditions that enable transparency to be an effective governance tool. We qualitatively examine the costs and benefits of alternative models of transparency, including a hypothetical, fully transparent system. We highlight how potential costs and benefits of greater transparency depend on both governance context and management goals, and identify opportunities for future research to address key information gaps.},

The study provides spatially explicit estimates of trawler fishing activity, compared with official fleet records published by the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean, revealing the distribution and intensity of trawl fishing activity not previously publicly tracked. Fishing grounds in the Strait of Sicily along the coast of Tunisia and North of Egypt showed an intensity of trawl fishing activity similar to the Adriatic Sea. This area is historically known to be subject to the highest trawling pressure in the Mediterranean, and also as one of the most heavily trawled regions in the world.

abstract = {Incidental mortality (bycatch) of seabirds in pelagic longline fisheries remains a major threat to many populations. The design and implementation of technical innovations aimed at reducing seabird bycatch rates have long been a focus of research. However, it has historically been difficult to extrapolate the efficacy of a particular mitigation measure to the scale of seabird populations or oceanic basins. Here, we develop an ecological risk assessment for five populations of threatened albatross and petrel species that forage in the south Atlantic Ocean. Since seabird bycatch rates are likely under-reported to fisheries regulatory bodies, we adopted a risk-based approach to predict differences in bycatch rates between different combinations and specifications of mitigation measures, comparing those currently specified by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) against best practice guidelines recommended by the Seabird Bycatch Working Group of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). We conclude that updating existing mitigation measure specifications for pelagic longlining in the South Atlantic to reflect current best practice guidelines would potentially reduce seabird mortality by 41-86\%, compared to use of any two of the three options by vessels. Simultaneous application of all three mitigation measures recommended as current ACAP best practice was predicted to reduce seabird mortality by 72-93\% and therefore should be considered by ICCAT as the most appropriate management measure for seabirds until further data are available to undertake more rigorous analyses.}

abstract = {Marine protected areas are increasingly touted for their role in conserving large marine predators such as sharks, but their efficacy is debated. Seventeen “shark sanctuaries” have been established globally, but longline fishing continues within many such jurisdictions, leading to unknown levels of bycatch mortality levels. Using public data from Global Fishing Watch and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, we quantified longline fishing within eight shark sanctuaries and estimated pelagic shark catch and mortality for seven pelagic shark species. Sanctuary mortality ranged from 600 individuals (Samoa) to 36,256 individuals (Federated States of Micronesia), equivalent to ~5\% of hypothesized sustainable levels for blue sharks to ~40\% for silky sharks, with high mortality levels in the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. Unsustainable mortality rates were exceeded for silky sharks in two sanctuaries, highlighting a need for additional stock assessments and implementation of bycatch reduction measures. Big data integration workflows represent a transformative tool in fisheries management, particularly for data-poor species. Big data workflows can estimate mortality for non-target species like sharks, potentially transforming fisheries management.}

First, the propagation and reception of the line of sight AIS transmissions was modelled around the coast of Scotland to identify areas where the use of AIS may be compromised. Using open source Geographic Information System and relational database software, computationally efficient methods of processing and analysing AIS data were explored. Three months of AIS data derived from 274 Scottish small scale fishing vessels were used to provide spatio-temporal analyses of trip duration and distance travelled, location of fishing activities, and vessel dependency on fishing grounds. The coverage, opportunities and challenges of using AIS are discussed together with broader applications and future developments.}

abstract = {Fisheries are one of the most important food sources for human consumption whilst being amongst the most impacting and extractive activities happening within the marine environment, which makes it imperative to properly manage this activity. To improve fisheries management, the precise quantification of fishing effort is of the outmost importance. Yet, present methods for effort estimation, especially at broad scales, are hampered by difficulties in data access and usually rely on coarse effort metrics or on costly data collection for quantifying fishing effort with higher resolution. In the present work, we propose an approach of high-resolution fishing effort estimates of net fishing, as length of nets operated by a given fleet, at the national level. It relies on sampling of effort, derived from classified and easy to access vessel tracking data – AIS, and fishery dependent data – logbook and landings data. The proposed methodology combines trip-based effort estimates, derived from AIS data, as a foundation to extrapolate the total fishing effort, through the number of fishing trips linked to official landings and logbook data. It is estimated that in the years from 2014 to 2020 an average of 180 200 km of static nets (gillnets and trammel nets), which corresponds to approximately 4.5 and 210 times the lengths of the equator and the Portuguese Atlantic coastline respectively, are used in Portuguese mainland waters each year, by a fleet of slightly more than 100 vessels. The presented methodology allows to quantify and study the variation of the nominal fishing effort, at country level, with a higher resolution than what is usually used and at very low cost. We argue that such methodologies need to be developed and explored in order to have better and more comprehensive estimates of fishing effort which will contribute and improve the sustainable management of fisheries and the marine environment.}

A methodology to map fishing grounds and analyze their spatial patterns was developed. The proposed approach combines VMS (Vessel Monitoring System) data, used for estimation of fishing effort, and catch data, used for modelling species presence. The methodology is based on the assessment of the probability of species presence using generalized additive models, the estimation of a presence threshold for binary classification of presence/absence, the spatial overlay between the probability of species presence and fishing effort to identify fishing grounds, and finally the analysis of spatial patterns to identify hot (clusters of high fishing effort and high probability of presence) and cold (clusters of low fishing effort and low probability of presence) spots. The methodology was applied in Greek waters to identify bottom trawl fishing grounds. Survey and commercial fishing data, collected from 1985 to 2008, were analysed. Fifteen demersal species were studied; all considered important target-species for bottom trawlers in the Mediterranean. The main fishing grounds in Greek waters for the fifteen studied species, as well as aggregated hot and cold spots, were identified and analyzed.}

An alternative to the VMS is represented by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which in the EU became compulsory in May 2014 for all fishing vessels of length above 15 meters. The aim of this paper is to assess the uptake of the AIS in the EU fishing fleet and the feasibility of producing a map of fishing effort with high spatial and temporal resolution at European scale. After analysing a large AIS dataset for the period January-August 2014 and covering most of the EU waters, we show that AIS was adopted by around 75\% of EU fishing vessels above 15 meters of length. Using the Swedish fleet as a case study, we developed a method to identify fishing activity based on the analysis of individual vessels’ speed profiles and produce a high resolution map of fishing effort based on AIS data. The method was validated using detailed logbook data and proved to be sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient to identify fishing grounds and effort in the case of trawlers, which represent the largest portion of the EU fishing fleet above 15 meters of length. Issues still to be addressed before extending the exercise to the entire EU fleet are the assessment of coverage levels of the AIS data for all EU waters and the identification of fishing activity in the case of vessels other than trawlers.},

Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data provides a means to understand the footprint (extent and intensity) of fishing activity. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data could offer a higher resolution alternative to VMS data, but differences in coverage and interpretation need to be better understood. VMS and AIS data were compared for individual scallop fishing vessels. There were substantial gaps in the AIS data coverage; AIS data only captured 26\% of the time spent fishing compared to VMS data. The amount of missing data varied substantially between vessels (45–99\% of each individuals' AIS data were missing). A cubic Hermite spline interpolation of VMS data provided the greatest similarity between VMS and AIS data. But the scale at which the data were analysed (size of the grid cells) had the greatest influence on estimates of fishing footprints. The present gaps in coverage of AIS may make it inappropriate for absolute estimates of fishing activity. VMS already provides a means of collecting more complete fishing position data, shielded from public view. Hence, there is an incentive to increase the VMS poll frequency to calculate more accurate fishing footprints.},

Integrating vessel monitoring systems (VMS) data with daily catch data from logbooks to explore the spatial distribution of catch and effort at high resolution. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 245–252. Vessel monitoring systems (VMS) automatically collect positional data from fishing vessels, and the data can be linked to catch data from logbooks to provide a census of spatially resolved catch-and-effort data. The most appropriate and practical method for integrating Irish VMS and logbook data is explored and validated. A simple speed rule is applied to identify VMS records that correspond to fishing activity. The VMS data are then integrated with the catch data from logbooks using date and vessel identifier. Several assumptions were investigated, and the resulting distribution maps of catch and effort appear to be unbiased. The method is illustrated with an example of a time-series of spatially explicit estimates of catch per unit effort. The proposed method is relatively simple and does not require specialist software or computationally intensive methods. It will be possible to generalize this approach to similar datasets that are available within the EU and many other regions. Analysis of integrated VMS and logbook data will allow fisheries data to be analysed on a considerably finer spatial scale than was possible previously, opening up a range of potential applications.},

  abstract = {VMStools is a package of open-source software, build using the freeware environment R, specifically developed for the processing, analysis and visualisation of landings (logbooks) and vessel location data (VMS) from commercial fisheries. Analyses start with standardized data formats for logbook (EFLALO) and VMS (TACSAT), enabling users to conduct a variety of analyses using generic algorithms. Embedded functionality handles erroneous data point detection and removal, métier identification through the use of clustering techniques, linking logbook and VMS data together in order to distinguish fishing from other activities, provide high-resolution maps of both fishing effort and -landings, interpolate vessel tracks, calculate indicators of fishing impact as listed under the Data Collection Framework at different spatio-temporal scales. Finally data can be transformed into other existing formats, for example to populate regional databases like FishFrame. This paper describes workflow examples of these features while online material allows a head start to perform these analyses. This software incorporates state-of-the art VMS and logbook analysing methods standardizing the process towards obtaining pan-European, or even worldwide indicators of fishing distribution and impact as required for spatial planning.}

  abstract = {As the human population has grown in recent decades, our dependence on ocean-supplied protein has rapidly increased. Kroodsma et al. took advantage of the automatic identification system installed on all industrial fishing vessels to map and quantify fishing efforts across the world (see the Perspective by Poloczanska). More than half of the world's oceans are subject to industrial-scale harvest, spanning an area four times that covered by terrestrial agriculture. Furthermore, fishing efforts seem not to depend on economic or environmental drivers, but rather social and political schedules. Thus, more active measures will likely be needed to ensure sustainable use of ocean resources. Science, this issue p. 904; see also p. 864 More than half of the ocean is exposed to industrial fishing activities. Although fishing is one of the most widespread activities by which humans harvest natural resources, its global footprint is poorly understood and has never been directly quantified. We processed 22 billion automatic identification system messages and tracked \&gt;70,000 industrial fishing vessels from 2012 to 2016, creating a global dynamic footprint of fishing effort with spatial and temporal resolution two to three orders of magnitude higher than for previous data sets. Our data show that industrial fishing occurs in \&gt;55\% of ocean area and has a spatial extent more than four times that of agriculture. We find that global patterns of fishing have surprisingly low sensitivity to short-term economic and environmental variation and a strong response to cultural and political events such as holidays and closures.}

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the effects of fishing fleets on both target and non-target species and managing these effects are essential to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) for marine ecosystems. The use of high resolution fishing effort data in environmental studies has allowed significant scientific progress with respect to the environmental impacts of real fishing fleets and provided a more realistic perspective on the wider ecological consequences of fishing disturbance. A new EU council regulation and its interpretation, aimed at protecting the confidentiality rights of individual fishers, are currently hampering scientific access to this high-resolution effort data and thus are endangering the provision of management advice based on best available knowledge. This study argues that the withholding of this information will seriously undermine the quality and accuracy of scientific output and ultimately damage fishers' livelihoods through poorly advised management. Furthermore, the council regulation runs contrary to the EU's initiative for greater transparency and its commitment to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the preservation of ecosystem services. The interpretation of the new EU council regulation by local administrations can thus only be viewed as a significant step back from these aims. Ultimately, while trying to protect fishers' rights it may work to their disadvantage and that of society.},

We combine satellite imagery, vessel GPS data and deep-learning models to map industrial vessel activities and offshore energy infrastructure across the world's coastal waters from 2017 to 2021. We find that 72--76{\%} of the world's industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, with much of that fishing taking place around South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa. We also find that 21--30{\%} of transport and energy vessel activity is missing from public tracking systems. Globally, fishing decreased by 12 $\pm$1{\%} at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels by 2021. By contrast, transport and energy vessel activities were relatively unaffected during the same period. Offshore wind is growing rapidly, with most wind turbines confined to small areas of the ocean but surpassing the number of oil structures in 2021. Our map of ocean industrialization reveals changes in some of the most extensive and economically important human activities at sea.},

  abstract  = {A key challenge in contemporary ecology and conservation is the accurate tracking of the spatial distribution of various human impacts, such as fishing. While coastal fisheries in national waters are closely monitored in some countries, existing maps of fishing effort elsewhere are fraught with uncertainty, especially in remote areas and the High Seas. Better understanding of the behavior of the global fishing fleets is required in order to prioritize and enforce fisheries management and conservation measures worldwide. Satellite-based Automatic Information Systems (S-AIS) are now commonly installed on most ocean-going vessels and have been proposed as a novel tool to explore the movements of fishing fleets in near real time. Here we present approaches to identify fishing activity from S-AIS data for three dominant fishing gear types: trawl, longline and purse seine. Using a large dataset containing worldwide fishing vessel tracks from 2011–2015, we developed three methods to detect and map fishing activities: for trawlers we produced a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using vessel speed as observation variable. For longliners we have designed a Data Mining (DM) approach using an algorithm inspired from studies on animal movement. For purse seiners a multi-layered filtering strategy based on vessel speed and operation time was implemented. Validation against expert-labeled datasets showed average detection accuracies of 83\% for trawler and longliner, and 97\% for purse seiner. Our study represents the first comprehensive approach to detect and identify potential fishing behavior for three major gear types operating on a global scale. We hope that this work will enable new efforts to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of global fishing effort and make global fisheries activities transparent to ocean scientists, managers and the public.},
